Build and run details will be added here, along with ongoing decisions and development notes.

## Development Notes
- The [Item] object returned by the API will be used as-is in an immutable data class.

## Decision Registry
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Architecture**: MVVM
- **Networking**: Retrofit
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose
